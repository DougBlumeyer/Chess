# Chess

## Command Line

Uses IO/Console for single key press input, and Unicode for chess piece symbols.

## AI

Okay, technically, "AI" here means the computer takes a random valid move.

Honestly, I still find it difficult to beat. I would say it's because it's
unpredictable, but who am I kidding - I just suck at chess.

## Timer

This was before I was introduced the wonders of asynchronous programming. I
tried to set up multiple Threads but ran out of time. So the timer runs in the
background, but doesn't update simultaneous to play.

## Save + Load

Uses YAML.
